<p><b>What does it do?</b></p>
BikeInCity is bike sharing system agregator.<br/>
All the bike sharing systems need a web and mobile application in order to allow the users to find the nearest bikes and stastions.<br/>
It does not make sence to have several applications installed in your phone for all the cities that you live in or that you only visit.<br/>
There should be one application and one web site which will give you the information that you need for whichever city you are at the moment.<br/>
